    "the difference between Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression; and the benefit the latter provides over the former：\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression uses one independent variable to predict the outcome of the dependent variable, while multi-linear regression uses muliple independent variable to predict the outcome of the dependent variable. Therefore, the latter has a better prediction accuracy in more complex model due to multiple factors used.  \n",

    "the difference between using a continuous variable and an indicator variable in Simple Linear Regression; and these two linear forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Continous variable are usually used to represent a range of numbers in an interval, such as age and height, and it shows the rate of change for that varibale. while indicator variable are binary numbers(0/1) to represent categorical variables like gender(male/female), it can let us find the categorical distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "the change that happens in the behavior of the model (i.e., the expected nature of the data it models) when a single indicator variable is introduced alongside a continuous variable to create a Multiple Linear Regression; and these two linear forms (i.e., the Simple Linear Regression versus the Multiple Linear Regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "the model of multi-linear regression can capture differences in the continuous effect across two categories. While the simple linear regression can only captures level differences between two groups. \n",
