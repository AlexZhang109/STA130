The Standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of the sample mean in the sample distribution. It measures how the sample mean spread from sample to sample, where samples are drew from the original data(population). So, standard deviation is how the data is spreading from the sample mean, whereas standard error of the mean is how the sample means is varing from the true population means when a lot of samples are sampled."

    "By bootstrapping the data 10,000 times, I calculated the 2.5% and 97.5% quantile and get a confidence interval between 0.9 and 5.6. Therefore, becasue interval doesnot contain 0, we reject h0, and this indicates that there's a increase in patient's health score. But if my h0 is there's a significant increase in patient's health score(Ex: Increase more than 2), then this confidence interval would be not sufficient to reject h0, we can't say there's a significent increase in the score.

    "If we calculate the true mean(3.3), we can see that the sample mean is exactly the population mean, which it means the estimate of mean is very accurate. However, becasue the population here is too small(less than 30) and I bootstrapped it 10000 times(Basically each sample is repeated a lot of times), this hypothesis test may also be seen as not trustworthy."

    "Chat history for Question 8: In this session, we discussed bootstrapping in statistics and its application to analyze health score differences between patients. We outlined the process of formulating null and alternative hypotheses, where h0\tstates there is no difference in health scores, and Ha suggests an increase in scores. We explored how to use bootstrapping to generate confidence intervals and how to interpret them in relation to the sample mean. Specifically, we established that if the confidence interval includes 0, we fail to reject H0 if it does not, we reject h0. While the sample mean provides a point estimate of the effect, the confidence interval is crucial for determining statistical significance. Both the sample mean and confidence interval should be reported for clarity in the analysis.\n",
